Database and Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to:

Print a simple "Hello World" message.

Create and interact with a SQLite database.

Perform basic data operations using Python and Pandas.

📂 Project Structure

Notebook/Script contains:

Cell 1: Prints hello world.

Cell 2:

Connects to a SQLite database (data_warehouse.db).

Creates a table called employees.

Inserts sample employee records.

Fetches and displays the data.

Converts the results into a Pandas DataFrame.

Displays DataFrame info, description, and missing value checks.

🛠️ Requirements

Install the following Python libraries before running the project:

pip install pandas matplotlib


(Standard libraries like sqlite3 are included with Python.)

▶️ How to Run

Clone/download this repository.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or Python script (.py).

Run all cells in order.

Expected output includes:

"hello world" printed to the console.

Confirmation of database creation and table setup.

Employee records displayed.

DataFrame overview (head, info, description).

Missing values summary.

📊 Example Output
hello world

Connected to database: data_warehouse.db
Table employees created successfully
Fetched Data:
(1, 'Alice', 24, 50000)
(2, 'Bob', 30, 60000)
(3, 'Charlie', 22, 55000)
(4, 'David', 35, 70000)
(5, 'Eva', 28, 65000)


Followed by DataFrame details and statistics.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add more database tables and relationships.

Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Visualize employee data using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Extend analysis for real-world HR or finance datasets.
